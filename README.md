# PPD text index

A text indexer for Jena Text to work the the price paid data. This
application currently requires an
[extended version of Jena](https://github.com/epimorphics/jena-config-doc-producer)
which allows the text document producer to be specified via the Assembler
description. In time, we aim to get these extensions folded back into the main
Jena codebase.
